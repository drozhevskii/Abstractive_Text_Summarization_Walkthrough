# Transformer networks for abstractive summarization
Code walkthrough of abstractive summarization with the use of RNNs or the newer networks: Transformers.
Original repository: https://github.com/Moeinh77/Transformer-networks-for-abstractive-summarization

Here, I try to walk through the complex code for abstractive summarization using transformer-type neutral network.
